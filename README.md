## Goals

- Practice manual data annotation with different formats of data. Images, text, etc.
- Handle edge cases and document my reasoning

## Structure

- Each folder contains one tagging mini-project
- Each project includes the labeled data (CSV format), a README, and notes for things like edge cases
