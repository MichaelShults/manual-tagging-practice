# Rusty Cars - Image Annotation Project  

This project is intended to demonstrate image annotation.  
The images are of cars of varying level of rust.  
For each image I annotated the visible level of rust using the following scale:  
- 0 = no rust  
- 1 = minor signs of rust  
- 2 = medium or major signs of rust  

The images are from Wikimedia Commons.  

## Project Artifacts
- 'car_rust_annotations.csv' – Annotation data  
- 'edge_cases.md' – Edge case notes  
- 'attributions.txt' – Source links for all images
